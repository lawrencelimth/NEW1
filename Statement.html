            <h2 class="vision-text">Our Statement of Faith</h2>
            <p>1. Concerning the Bible: The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are inspired by
              God and thus infallible, completely reliable, and the supreme authority in all matters of
              faith and practice.
              (2 Tim. 3:14-17; 2 Pet. 1:16-21; Matt. 5:17-8; Luke 24:25-27, 44-45; John 10:35; 14:23-
              26; 16:12-15).
            </p>
            <p>2. Concerning God: There is one true God, eternally existent in three Persons -- Father, Son, and
              Holy Spirit -- and entirely sovereign over creation, history, revelation, salvation, and final
              judgement.
              (Gen. 1:1-2, 26-27; Deut. 6:4-5; Isa. 40:13-14, 25-28; Dan. 2:20-22; Matt. 11:25-30; 28:18-
              20; John 1:1, 14, 18; 14:6-10, 16-17; Acts 5:3-4; 17:24-31; 1 Cor. 2:6-12; 8:4-6; 2 Cor.
              13:14; Eph. 1:3-14).
            </p>
            <p>3. Concerning our Lord Jesus Christ: He is God incarnate, was born of the virgin Mary, lived
              a sinless human life and performed divine miracles; He died as a vicarious, atoning
              sacrifice by shedding His blood for our sins and to destroy the works of Satan; He was
              raised bodily from the dead, ascended to heaven, continues His mediatorial work, and will
              personally return in power and glory.
              (Isa. 7:14; 9:6-7; Matt. 1:18-25; John 1:1, 14; Phil. 2:6-11; Col. 2:9; Rom. 3:24-26; I Cor.
              15:1-28; 2 Cor. 5:14-15, 21; I Tim. 2:5-6: Heb. 1:1-3; 2:14-17; 7:24:25; 1 Pet. 3:18; 1 John
              3:2, 5, 8; Acts 1:9-11; 1 Thess. 4:16-17; Tit. 2:11-14; Rev. 19:1 to 22:21).

            <h2 class="vision-text">Continued</h2>
            <p>4. Concerning the Holy Spirit: The Holy Spirit was sent by the Father to bear witness to His
              Son; His power is essential for the regeneration of sinners, and His indwelling presence in
              all believers is vital for their progressive sanctification and witness.
              (John 3:5-8; 14:16-17; 15:26-27; 16:8-11; Acts 1:8; Rom. 8:1-17, 26-30; I Cor. 12:1-13; 2
              Cor. 3:17-18; Gal. 5: 16-26; Eph. 5:15-21; I Thess. 4:3, 7-8; 5:16-24; 2 Thess. 2:13-14).
            </p>
            <p>5. Concerning Man: Created originally in the image of God, man became a fallen, lost and
              sinful being, who can be redeemed and restored to Ministry with God only by grace
              through personal faith in Christ, apart from works.
              (Gen. 1:26-27; 3:1-24; Psa. 8:3-8; Rom. 3:9-28; 5:1-21; Eph. 2:1-9; Tit. 3:4-7).

            </p>
            <p>6. Concerning the Church: Through their union with the Head, all believers in our Lord Jesus
              Christ are one in His Spirit and belong to His Body, the Church, which is committed to
              fulfil His Great Committee, by declaring His Gospel, discipling converts in all nations,
              and discharging its social responsibilities for the common good and for His glory.
              (Psa. 96:1-4; Matt. 28:18-20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:45-48; John 17; 20:21; Acts 1:8; 4:12;
              Rom. 1:14-17; 10:6-17; 13:1-10; 1 Cor. 9:16-23; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:13-22; 3:6; 4:1-16; Col.
              1:13-29; Jas. 2:14-26; 1 Pet. 2:9-17).

            </p>
            <p>7. Concerning the Future: At Christ's return, there will be the bodily resurrection of all the
              dead -- of believers to eternal blessedness, and of unbelievers to eternal punishment -- and
              the perfection of the glorious Kingdom of God in a new heaven and a new earth.
              (John 5:27-29; 1 Cor. 15:20-28, 35-37; 2 Cor. 5:1-10: Phil. 3:20-21; 2 Thess. 1:5-10; Heb.
              9:27-28: 2 Pet. 3:10-13: Rev. 20:11 to 22:5).
